# Response-Based Knowledge Distillation for Multilingual Jailbreak Prevention Unwittingly Compromises Safety

This repository contains the official implementation for the paper: "Response-Based Knowledge Distillation for Multilingual Jailbreak Prevention Unwittingly Compromises Safety." This research explores using knowledge distillation (KD) to improve the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) against multilingual jailbreak attacks and uncovers a counterintuitive degradation in model safety.

Our core experiment involved fine-tuning three student models—`Llama-3-8B`, `Gemma-2-2B`, and `Qwen3-8B`—on a dataset of "safe" refusal responses generated by a teacher model (`OpenAI o1-mini`). The goal was to teach the student models how to refuse harmful, multilingual prompts. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the fine-tuning process systematically weakened the models' safety alignment.

### Key Findings

**Safety Degradation**: Fine-tuning on "safe" refusal data from the teacher model inadvertently increased the Jailbreak Success Rate (JSR) for all student models by up to 16.6 percentage points
**Reasoning-Safety Trade-off**: The attempt to instill safety led to a consistent decline in general reasoning capabilities across all models, as measured by the GSM8K benchmark
**Causal Analysis**: We attribute the observed degradation to a combination of factors including nuanced 'boundary' data, amplification of teacher vulnerabilities, and catastrophic forgetting.

### Methodology Overview

Our experimental pipeline consists of five key stages:

1.  **Data Curation**: We sourced ~28,000 multilingual jailbreak prompts from the XSafety dataset (https://github.com/Jarviswang94/Multilingual_safety_benchmark).
2.  **Teacher Response Generation**: The teacher model, `OpenAI o1-mini`, generated safe refusal responses for these prompts.
3.  **Distillation Dataset Creation**: We paired the prompts and the teacher's refusals to create the fine-tuning dataset.
4.  **LoRA PEFT**: We used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently fine-tune the student models on this datasets.
5.  **Evaluation**: We evaluated the models on the MultiJail benchmark, using `GPT-4o` as an automated judge to classify responses as safe, unsafe, or invalid.
